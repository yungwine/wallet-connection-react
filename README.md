# TON Starter Template - Telegram Web App (TWA)
> Starter template for a new TWA interacting with the TON blockchain 

# Overview
This project is part of a set of 3 typical repositories needed for a blockchain dapp running on TON blockchain:

* [Smart contracts in FunC that are deployed on-chain](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts)
* Web frontend for interacting with the dapp from a web browser (coming soon)
* Telegram bot for interacting with the dapp from inside Telegram messenger (this repo)


The project is highly-opinionated, and there are many other alternate routes it could have taken. Some examples:
- Supports only tonhub and its corresponding session mediating library, ton-x. Feel free to contribute support for other wallets!
- Uses vite with react (alternative to create-react-app)
- Uses the `ton` npm package

# Prerequesities
* Node.js v16 (other versions may work, needs more testing)
* Tonhub wallet installed on a mobile phone

# What does this repo contain?
* A react-based TWA-ready app, interacting with TON
* Github actions set to deploy app to github pages
* A script to connect a telegram bot to the deployed app
